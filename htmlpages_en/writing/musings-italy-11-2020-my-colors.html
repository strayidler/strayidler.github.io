<h1 class="myh1">Italy 11-2020: my Colors</h1><br><br><br>

<p class="normalpar"> <i>In this article, I do not intend to advise anyone to travel, nor I want to convince people to stay at home. Simply and generally, I will tell my experiences and share my thoughts, without the presumption of wanting to influence those of other people. I firmly believe that everyone can decide for themselves, through their own evaluation parameters. In addition, during my travels, I always respected all local restrictions and rules, on which I constantly tried to inquire beforehand. Finally, this article is partially written in an ironic way: I advise those who find it inappropriate in a pandemic context to end the reading here.</i><br>
        <br>

Is there anyone who is lucky enough to have forgotten the "splendid" 2020? Well, you may want to know that warm colors have become fashionable in Italy for the autumn-winter season. Yes, paraphrasing Caesar in his "De Bello Gallico", I will begin by saying that Italy is divided into three parts. With so many beautiful colors that turn on and off intermittently: well, we are approaching Christmas. They are cute colors, which pair well with each other: red, orange and yellow. Eliminating green zones was a great idea. Frankly, they were an eyesore, placed close to the other colors. And we Italians care about style, it is well known.<br>
        <br>

Each color has its own rules and methods for playing hide and seek. For example, if you are in the red zone, you must remain hidden for at least three weeks. In the yellow zone, however, it is enough to hide at night. I, who am a half nerd, am pretty good at this game. And then I heard that they lowered the difficulty level compared to the spring edition. For the "noobs"? Strange, by now the Italians seemed to be quite experienced...<br>
        <br>

          style="max-width:100%" alt="Sardinia: beach"> <figcaption></figcaption> </figure>
      <br>


<p class="normalpar"> Okay, but the point is this game gets tricky when you have to remember the mottled, ever-changing color scheme. What if one accidentally hides inside another color? I do not want to think about it. I am an unsophisticated person, I know. To simplify my life and avoid missteps, I wanted to avoid any risk. I chose an island: Sardinia.<br> <br>

 </p>

<p class="indentpar"> But what color is Sardinia? Let's see.<br>
        <br>
      </p>


<p class="normalpar">
To begin with, it presents itself to me with a much more linear fabric of colors: sand, sea, sky. A few other lines (in the photo) were added by me. But the whole is easy to decode. It calms the soul, relaxes it, but without making it sleepy. Okay, but am I really talking about the blue of Sardinia? As if it wasn't known to everyone...<br> <br>

 </p>

 

<figure class="linktointpages"> <img class="blogimages"

          style="max-width:100%" alt="Sardinia: beer on the beach"> <figcaption></figcaption> </figure>
      <br>

<p class="normalpar"> And in fact, I was standing there playing in the yellow zone, trying to figure out if the area, the sun or the beer on the beach was more yellow. At the end of November? Oh yes. I am not a winter animal. And I love taking refuge in the warm blue.<br>
        <br>
</p>

<figure class="linktointpages"> <img class="blogimages"
          src="../../img/writingimg/mus2colors/itacolor3.jpg"
          style="max-width:100%" alt="Sardinia: Carbonia"> <figcaption>Sardinia: Carbonia</figcaption> </figure>
      <br>

 <p class="normalpar"> But then Sardinia told me: â€œNo, my dear! I have many other colors. "And it gave me a whitish day in Sulcis. Only that, huh. Then it returned to its turquoise hues. But that's how I imagined a place like Carbonia, whose center is an unmistakable legacy of a not exactly worthy of pride period. But Fascism is still part of history and I wanted to go and embrace one of its urban examples with my eyes.<br>
        <br></p>


<figure class="linktointpages"> <img class="blogimages"

          style="max-width:100%" alt="Sardinia: rocks"> <figcaption></figcaption> </figure>
      <br>   


 <p class="normalpar"> A little farther on, on the island of Sant'Antioco, cackles of clouds chased me all day, lending a little whiteness to the waters, and then colliding with the earthy tones of the rocks. But always there, just before abdicating, the day gave me a hammer of light. A gash, a daring percussion, bordering on the unreal. "You didn't expect that, did you?" Sweet was the whisper of this land. A caress on the neck, a thoughtful reconciliation.
<br>
        <br>

          style="max-width:100%" alt="Flamingos in Cagliari"> <figcaption>Flamingos in Cagliari</figcaption> </figure>
      <br> 

<p class="normalpar"> But pink, no, who would have expected it? That of the flamingos. A little remote, perhaps. But for me never so close. And I just wasn't prepared for purple sprinkled on the streets, in a decorative dedication that in these times is almost essential for the soul.<br>
        <br>
</p>

<figure class="linktointpages"> <img class="blogimages"
          src="../../img/writingimg/mus2colors/itacolor7.jpg"
          style="max-width:100%" alt="Sardinia: decorative vase"> <figcaption></figcaption> </figure>
      <br> 

<p class="normalpar"> As the food is, of course. But, but, but ... What do I see!? Red? Or maybe it's orange? No, they are not colors I want to see. I'll wait for Christmas to come for these. And since today red means closure, I have to ship this insolent sauce in my stomach. Into lockdown.<br>
        <br>
</p>

<figure class="linktointpages"> <img class="blogimages"

          style="max-width:100%" alt="Sardinia: Culurgiones"> <figcaption>Sardinia: Culurgiones</figcaption> </figure>
      <br> 

<p class="normalpar">Speaking of closures, it's not bad to be swallowed by such a door, whose wood seems to tell a fairy tale, giving us back the hours of life that have been stolen from us. It wasn't my wood, unfortunately, but for a few seconds I let myself be entangled..<br>
        <br>
</p>

<figure class="linktointpages"> <img class="blogimages"
          src="../../img/writingimg/mus2colors/itacolor9.jpg"
          style="max-width:100%" alt="Sardinia: door"> <figcaption></figcaption> </figure>
      <br> 



<figure class="linktointpages"> <img class="blogimages"
          src="../../img/writingimg/mus2colors/itacolor10.jpg"
          style="max-width:100%" alt="Sardinia: on the train to the north"> <figcaption></figcaption> </figure>
      <br> 

<p class="normalpar"> And then off to the north, on the train in the green, where even the sky has tried to catch us again, throwing striated offshoots towards us. He did not succeed: I then glimpsed him mirroring himself in the sea, while we waited for him, letting our legs dangle in the void.<br>
        <br></p>

<figure class="linktointpages"> <img class="blogimages"
          src="../../img/writingimg/mus2colors/itacolor11.jpg"
          style="max-width:100%" alt="Sardinia: Alghero"> <figcaption></figcaption> </figure>
      <br> 

<p class="normalpar"> And it is here that Sardinia has dropped all its cards together. In Bosa its colors exploded, they enveloped me, they divided my thoughts. Not in three, but in millions of areas: all those that make up the nuances of our mood.<br>
        <br></p>

<figure class="linktointpages"> <img class="blogimages"
          src="../../img/writingimg/mus2colors/itacolor12.jpg"
          style="max-width:100%" alt="Sardinia: Bosa"> <figcaption>Sardinia: Bosa</figcaption> </figure>
      <br> 

<p class="normalpar"> In the complexity of the period, I decided to try to find cues for a smile, aware that the world is crying. A bit like two ventilation holes (in the photo) that have tried to become glasses, even knowing they cannot block the passage of air.<br>
        <br></p>

<figure class="linktointpages"> <img class="blogimages"
          src="../../img/writingimg/mus2colors/itacolor13.jpg"
          style="max-width:100%" alt="Sardinia: Street Art"> <figcaption></figcaption> </figure>
      <br> 


<p class="indentpar"> Because colors are not just for giving directions. They were born to suggest emotions. I presume.<br>
