      <h1 class="myh1">A dive into Skopje</h1><br><br><br>
 
      <p class="normalpar"> When I started traveling, I think I did
        it mainly to see live things that I had only seen in photos,
        taste foods and have experiences that I had only heard of. In
        short, I was traveling to cover my expectations. Today, in a
        way, I could almost say the opposite. Of course, I still keep
        planning itineraries, I keep wanting to satisfy the curiosities
        that I bring from home. But I come back happier when I notice
        that I go back with unexpected impressions. A couple of years
        ago (2018), it happened to me in Skopje, North Macedonia. </p>
      <p class="normalpar"> I was only there for a few days and I
        also visited the area around the capital and <i>Orhid</i>. I
        have few doubts in saying that the latter is more beautiful,
        that it offers a better tourist experience. But this is true for
        what I was many years ago. Today I prefer to talk about the
        capital instead. And I could start reviewing its history and try
        to explain it, but would it be fun? I prefer to tell it the way
        I saw it, almost like from a child's gaze.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <figure class="linktointpages"> <img class="blogimages"

          style="max-width:100%" alt="Skopje outoddors cafe"> <figcaption></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <br>
      <p></p>
      <p class="normalpar"> I remember landing in Skopje in the
        early afternoon and got to know the city center just before
        sunset. Before getting there, however, what is the first thing I
        notice? The cafes, people everywhere who spend hours at the
        cafes, just like in Italy. I swear that when I passed by after
        dinner, some of the people I had seen on the way there were
        still sitting there. I felt at home.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <figure class="linktointpages"> <img class="blogimages"
          src="../../img/blogimg/mk1sko/skopje2.jpg"
          style="max-width:100%" alt="Skopje city center"> <figcaption></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <br>
      <p></p>
      <p class="normalpar"> On the other hand, the part that
        somewhat surprised me, but also amused me, was the city center.
        I mean, what is that ship on the <i>Vardar River</i>? Okay, I
        think it's a restaurant, but I really didn't expect it, in front
        of that kind of classical building, which actually is the
        Archaeological Museum. But this is not enough. Because then we
        also have a wealth of statues with a socialist flavor. Something
        from that period had to remain, right?<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <figure class="linktointpages"> <img class="blogimages"
          src="../../img/blogimg/mk1sko/skopje3.jpg"
          style="max-width:100%" alt="Skopje city center"> <figcaption></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <br>
      <p></p>
      <p class="normalpar"> And, just to add something more, why
        not color the buildings with purple lights? Colors were
        mutating, if I remember correctly, in honor of sobriety. But I
        liked this aspect a lot: just turn around sixty degrees and the
        city changes. You find the mosque, you discover the ancient
        Turkish soul...<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <figure class="linktointpages"> <img class="blogimages"
          src="../../img/blogimg/mk1sko/skopje4.jpg"
          style="max-width:100%" alt="Skopje Clock Tower"> <figcaption>
          Skopje Clock Tower </figcaption> </figure>
      <br>
      <p></p>
      <p class="normalpar"> In fact, the next day we went to look
        for the <i>Clock Tower</i>, which has Ottoman and
        sixteenth-century origins. And maybe that's why we found it
        quite wrapped up, under maintenance. Et voila, my wife takes an
        artistic photo, so that I could appreciate it better.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <figure class="linktointpages"> <img class="blogimages"
          src="../../img/blogimg/mk1sko/skopje5.jpg"
          style="max-width:100%" alt="Skopje streets"> <figcaption></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <br>
      <p></p>
      <p class="normalpar"> I don't remember how, but I got into
        lesser known streets to tourists. And even there I was able to
        see another city. Full of even more traditional cafes, having
        almost sleepy rhythms. Except of course with regards to
        children. One of them darted in front of us with his bike a
        dozen times. He disappeared to one side and came out of nowhere.
        Lucky him!<br>
        <br>

          Pasha Mosque</figcaption> </figure>
      <br>
      <p></p>
      <p class="normalpar"> Returning to the area of â€‹â€‹the old <i>Bazaar

          of Skopje</i>, which is a rather large one, we found ourselves
        in front of the <i>Mustafa Pasha Mosque</i>, built in 1492.
        This year reminds me of something ... Hmm ... I'm still
        thinking, I apologize. As I meditate on it, I put here the photo
        of the interior of the Mosque. But I'm not so sure it's the
        right photo. It should, however. I hope so.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <figure class="linktointpages"> <img class="blogimages"

          Pasha Mosque</figcaption> </figure>
      <br>
      <p></p>
      <p class="normalpar"> What else? The fortress whose origin is
        ... Ottoman? Balkan? Of course not! This has Byzantine origins.
        And it allows you to admire the city quite well from above. Also
        because there is not much left of the fortress. However, walking
        along the crenellated walls was very pleasant.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <figure class="linktointpages"> <img class="blogimages"
          src="../../img/blogimg/mk1sko/skopje8.jpg"

      <br>
      <p></p>
      <p class="normalpar"> Well, since we were drunk with mixes of
        styles, it seemed appropriate to go back to the area of â€‹â€‹the
        old bazaar (where there is certainly no shortage of bars) to
        drink a refreshing beer. So as to inebriate us also with a
        little alcohol. And maybe that's why I started seeing umbrellas
        hanging in the air. With just a single beer? Wow, I thought I
        could stand alcohol better. </p>
      <p class="normalpar"> Maybe not, though. Because then, in
        front of my wife, I thanked the young waitress for always being
        smiling. I said already that I am innocent like a child, right?
        I usually don't get many smiles, it seemed right to thank for
        the abundance. In general, during my short stay, the Macedonians
        did not skimp on Balkan heat. And for this I am grateful.<br>
        <br>
      </p>

      </figure>
      <br>
      <p></p>
      <p class="normalpar"> However, every now and then I go back
        to wondering, but isn't it that I only imagined about being in
        Skopje? No, because after the beer I decide to go back to the
        hotel for a while. I go back to the city center, across the
        river again and I find this image: what is that diver doing on
        the <i>Vardar</i> river? Also, against the current. But are we
        really sure that the river always flows in the same direction
        here?<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p class="normalpar"> </p>
      <figure class="linktointpages"> <img class="blogimages"

      <br>
      <p></p>
      <p class="normalpar"> <b> Some additional information: <br>
        </b> Skopje has its international airport. The only other
        international airport in the country is located in the
        aforementioned <i>Ohrid</i>, on the border with Albania. The
        two cities are also connected to each other by public transport.
        The bus ride takes about three hours. Personally, I went to <i>Ohrid</i>
        for a one-day excursion, but it would have been more appropriate
        to stop for at least one night. </p>
      <p class="normalpar"> <b> Interesting places around Skopje:
        </b> <br>
        - the aqueduct of Skopje (not far from the city), whose
        construction period is uncertain <br>
        - the <i>Church of St. Panteleimon</i>, in the village of <i>Gorno

          Nerezi</i> <br>
        - the <i>Matka</i> lake and canyon, perhaps the best site among
        the mentioned ones <br>
        - the <i>Millennium Cross</i>, on <i>Mount Vodno</i>, 66
        meters high. I saw it without problems from a distance, but I
        did not climb the top of the mountain <br>
