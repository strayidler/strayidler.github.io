      <p class="normalpar"> 
        Are you a fan of animation or of fantasy fiction? Are you a
        gamer? Don‚Äôt worry if you aren‚Äôt, even the real world may let
        your imagination fly. Let‚Äôs hit the road, I‚Äôll take you to La
        Paz, Bolivia today.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <figure class="linktointpages"> <img class="blogimages"
          src="../../img/blogimg/bo1paz/lapaz1.jpg"
          style="max-width:100%" alt="La Paz: the Slanted City"> <figcaption>La

          Paz: the Slanted City</figcaption> </figure>
      <br>
      <p class="normalpar"> Well, actually I don‚Äôt think La Paz is
        a real place on the Earth. I mean, I have photos, memories and
        everything, but I still cannot believe I‚Äôve really been there
        and that it wasn‚Äôt all my brain fabrication. In any case, I
        think it‚Äôs worth narrating it. <br>
        <br>
        Going back to the fictional works, I‚Äôve always been fascinated
        by the way they‚Äôre able to create different worlds in a very
        sharp manner. For example, the city of orange sand, the town of
        pyramids, the region of concrete, the country of talking
        elephants and so on. All it‚Äôs focused on a specific feature and
        everything else is left aside.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <figure class="linktointpages"> <img class="blogimages"

          style="max-width:100%" alt="La Paz streets #1"> <figcaption>La

          Paz streets #1</figcaption> </figure>
      <br>
      <p class="normalpar"> Having been in La Paz only for a couple
        of days, I think I made a similar simplification. La Paz is for
        me the ‚ÄúSlanted City‚Äù. Walking around ‚Äî and please do it slowly
        because 3600m of altitude can make you easily dizzy ‚Äî you‚Äôre
        almost surrounded by roads that go uphill or downhill. Yes, some
        other cities may be like that too, but how many of them have a
        complex cableway system instead of metro lines?<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <figure class="linktointpages"> <img class="blogimages"

          Paz streets #2</figcaption> </figure>
      <br>
      <p class="normalpar"> Originally my visit to Bolivia was
        planned as a detour from my Peru trip. My goal was going to the
        ‚ÄúSalar de Uyuni‚Äù, which is another great highlight of the
        country (I talk about it <a class="link1footer" href="bolivia-uyuni-only-by-heart.html">here</a>). In the beginning, La Paz was simply a convenient place
        to visit along the itinerary. I honestly didn‚Äôt expect I could
        be enchanted so much by it.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <figure class="linktointpages"> <img class="blogimages"

          Approaching La Paz by bus </figcaption> </figure>
      <br>
      <p class="normalpar"> After a long bus trip from Puno, Peru,
        my wife and I reached La Paz a bit before dusk: still in time
        for a quick visit and a nice dinner. As soon as we arrived, we
        understood how things work there: you need to go up, then down,
        then maybe up again. While you just walk in a slow pace, kids on
        the street will run to reach the football field or whatever
        space lets them play: altitude means nothing to them.<br>
        <br>

          Art in La Paz</figcaption> </figure>
      <br>
      <p class="normalpar"> The city may appear a bit messy, okay,
        but it‚Äôs incredibly gritty with stalls and street art. But it
        wouldn‚Äôt be unreal if it was just about being slanted. Citizens
        of Slanted City need to show a feature too.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <figure class="linktointpages"> <img class="blogimages"

      <br>
      <p class="normalpar"> Otherwise, a poor stray idler may think
        he‚Äôs still awake and not daydreaming. So, I will say that the
        inhabitants of Slanted City are called ‚Äú<i>Cholitas</i>‚Äù. What
        did you say? Are you objecting that Cholitas are only some
        women, mainly elder ones, dressed in a colorful and traditional
        clothing style? Well, you may be right, but I prefer to overlook
        the remaining residents. Please let me keep dreaming and do
        yourself a favor: dream along.<br>
        <br>

          San Francisco)</figcaption> </figure>
      <br>
      <p class="normalpar"> Are you ready? Then follow me. Let‚Äôs
        start from Murillo Square (<i>Plaza Murillo</i>) and get to
        Saint Francis Church (<i>Iglesia de San Francisco</i>). Do you
        prefer a plainer route? Take your time, but to reach the Witches
        Market (<i>Mercado de las Brujas</i>) you will need to go up. If
        you want to buy some potions, a dried frog or some other bizarre
        things is up to you: I warned you already that this place is
        located on another planet.<br>

          Brujas)"> <figcaption>Witches Market (Mercado de las Brujas)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <br>
      <p class="normalpar"> Are you tired already? Stay resolute,
        we will keep going up. Let‚Äôs take the cableway (<i>Mi Telef√©rico</i>),

        to reach <i>El Alto</i>. What‚Äôs the meaning of the name? Of
        course, it means ‚ÄúThe Height‚Äù, but also ‚ÄúThe Halt‚Äù. I‚Äôll take
        both names, as it‚Äôs really worth getting up there and stop for a
        few minutes to admire the view of La Paz city. <br>
        <br>
        (Honestly, I felt a bit dizzy in the cableway, especially
        getting back down to the city. Please evaluate if it‚Äôs a good
        idea for you to take it. You can always reach the city of El
        Alto by road.)<br>

      <p class="normalpar"> What‚Äôs left? Since we climbed so high,
        why not pushing a bit more and start flying? No, I don‚Äôt mean to
        grow wings and fly: but we can take a crowded ‚Äúcolectivo‚Äù
        (shared taxi or minibus) to float to the <i>‚ÄúValle de la Luna‚Äù
          (Moon Valley)</i>. It‚Äôs an intriguing area, with many canyons
        and spires, whose landscapes resemble the ones on the moon,
        hence the name.<br>

        </b> Now that you‚Äôve been fairly inebriated, take a rest. Let
        your brain relax and try to convince yourself that it wasn‚Äôt
        just a rash of imagination. It was all real. Or maybe not? </p>
      <p class="normalpar"> <b>Some additional information:</b> <br>
        - despite being the city where the Bolivian government is
        located, La Paz is not the capital city (the official one is
        Sucre). It is served by the international airport of El Alto,
        which is the highest international airport in the world.
        International connections are mainly towards other South
        American destinations. <br>
        - Another common way to reach La Paz (as I did) is taking a
        detour from Puno, within a Peru itinerary. Bus companies serve
        the route, you will need to cross the border by land. <br>
      </p>
      <p class="normalpar"><b>Interesting sites around La Paz:</b>
        <br>
        - the already mentioned <i>‚ÄúValle de La Luna‚Äù (Moon Valley)</i>,
        around 10km south from La Paz. Besides taxi and shared taxi,
        there are also guided tours from the city. <br>
        - <i>Tiwanaku</i>, a Pre-Columbian archaeological site and
        UNESCO World Heritage site. It‚Äôs located 72 km west of La Paz.
        You can get there by bus or booking a tour. Personally, I didn‚Äôt
        visit this place, but I think it‚Äôs worth listing it. <br>
